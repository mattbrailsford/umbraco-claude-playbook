## Why the change

{Exactly one sentence: the problem this PR solves and what becomes possible once it ships.}

## Special things to note

- {Every `Needs a decision`/`Consider reverting` item decision-review flagged, first, each
  prefixed with its verdict — e.g. "**Needs a decision:** {what and why}" or "**Consider
  reverting:** {what and why}". A plain `Looks fine as documented` item gets no prefix.}
- {Then one bullet each for migrations, compatibility constraints, or other deliberate
  omissions decision-review wouldn't have caught — no fixed count, but each one must be
  something the reviewer genuinely needs before approving, not a restatement of the change
  outline below. Write "- None." if there's nothing at all.}

## Change outline

{Use the smallest combination of views from references/diagram-conventions.md that explains
the implementation. Only include a view that actually changed — omit the rest. Order them
however tells the story best; a data structure or contract usually comes before the code that
uses it.}

{...one short sentence introducing the view...}

```diff
{the diagram}
```

{Repeat for each relevant view — file tree, component tree, call chain, table/contract diff,
manifest registration diff, pseudocode. Prefer `diff` for a change to an existing shape; show
the whole block only when most of it is new or a diff would hide ownership or order.}
